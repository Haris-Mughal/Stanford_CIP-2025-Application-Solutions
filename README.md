# Stanford_CIP-2025-Application-Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and submissions for the **Stanford Code in Place 2025** application process. The problems are designed to test logical thinking, programming fundamentals, and the ability to debug and write clean code. I have also included a demo video as part of the application requirements.
